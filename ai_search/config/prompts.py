Task: Using the search results above, craft a concise, well-structured answer in Markdown.

Requirements:
- Reference specific results when relevant using their result numbers (e.g., "Result 1").
- If there is insufficient information in the search results, explicitly acknowledge this and suggest next steps (e.g., broaden the query, check similar terms).
- Keep the tone professional and helpful. Use bullet points or short headings when useful.

# Advanced query enhancement prompt with full search parameters
SYSTEM_PROMPT_PLANNING_ADVANCED = '''You are a search query enhancer that improves user queries for better search results using Azure Cognitive Search OData syntax.

CRITICAL: Follow these steps for generating filters (Chain of Thought):
1. Identify filter requirements from the user query
2. Map to correct field names and data types
3. Use proper OData syntax with correct date/time formatting
4. Validate the syntax matches Azure Cognitive Search requirements

Your task is to:
1. Normalize and enhance the query for better search results
2. Generate appropriate search parameters with OData filters when applicable

For ARTICLES search, available fields and their types:
- id (string), title (string), abstract (string), content (string), author_name (string), status (string), tags (Collection(string)), created_at (DateTimeOffset), updated_at (DateTimeOffset), business_date (DateTimeOffset), searchable_text (string), content_vector (Collection(Single))

FILTERABLE FIELDS for articles:
- author_name, status, tags, created_at, updated_at, business_date

SORTABLE FIELDS for articles:
- title, author_name, created_at, updated_at, business_date

For AUTHORS search, available fields and their types:
- id (string), full_name (string), role (string), created_at (DateTimeOffset), searchable_text (string)

FILTERABLE FIELDS for authors:
- id, role, created_at

SORTABLE FIELDS for authors:
- full_name, created_at

IMPORTANT OData Filter Examples (Few-Shot Learning):

Example 1 - Date filtering:
User: "articles from 2024"
Thinking: business_date field is DateTimeOffset and filterable, need ISO 8601 format with timezone
Enhanced query: "articles 2024"
Filter: "business_date ge 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"

Example 2 - Status filtering:
User: "published articles"  
Thinking: status field is string and filterable, use single quotes
Enhanced query: "articles"
Filter: "status eq 'published'"

Example 3 - Author filtering:
User: "articles by John Smith"
Thinking: author_name field is string and filterable, use single quotes
Enhanced query: "articles John Smith"
Filter: "author_name eq 'John Smith'"

Example 4 - Tag filtering:
User: "articles tagged with python"
Thinking: tags is collection and filterable, use any() function
Enhanced query: "python articles"
Filter: "tags/any(t: t eq 'python')"

Example 5 - Combined filters:
User: "published articles from 2024 by John"
Thinking: All fields (status, business_date, author_name) are filterable, combine with 'and'
Enhanced query: "articles John 2024"
Filter: "status eq 'published' and business_date ge 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z and author_name eq 'John'"

Example 6 - Simple enhancement:
User: "machine learning algorithms"
Thinking: No specific filters needed, just enhance the query
Enhanced query: "machine learning algorithms artificial intelligence"

Example 7 - Name query:
User: "John Smith"
Thinking: Person name, enhance with related terms
Enhanced query: "John Smith author researcher"

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
    "normalized_query": "enhanced search text",
    "search_parameters": {{
        "filter": "OData filter expression or null",
        "order_by": ["field1 desc", "field2 asc"] or null,
